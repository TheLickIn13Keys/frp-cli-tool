# frp-cli-tool
An easy to use, one command tool for frp (https://github.com/fatedier/frp/). The goal is to make it like ngrock, but self hosted.

- Automatically creates a tunnel from client to server 
- Configures cloudflare and domain if enabled 
- Configures and provisions https certs
- And more!
- WIP

Might also make an imporved GUI to fulfil "the dream" as specified in https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling, but just a cli for now
